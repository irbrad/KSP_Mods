Version 0.4.3
-------------
*Release date: 06/01/2014*

Version 0.4.2
-------------
*Release date: 01/01/2014*

* RAPIER support.
* Delta V and burn time readout for RCS (because I could).
* TWR readout for engines.
* Added slider for change the scale of CoM markers.
* Set to ignore all ladders as they incorrectly show mass in the editor, much
  like landing gears.

Version 0.4.1
-------------
*Release date: 24/12/13*

* KSP 0.23 fixes.
* Account tweakables in fuel tanks and engines.

* Dynamic list of resources in mass window.

Version 0.4
-----------
*Release date: 19/10/13*

* GUI added.
* Show magnitudes of torque, translation and other information.
* Some resource options for DCoM marker.
* Option for hide CoM/DCoM markers.
* Removed M and P keybinds.
* FIX: translation keybindings should match the correct direction in VAB.
  (they won't match in SPH)
* FIX: the plugin could cause important fps drops while in VAB/SPH.

Version 0.3.2
-------------
*Release date: 30/08/2013*

* Basic engine support, enable with the P key.
* Use translation keybindings from game settings (M and P keys are still
  hardcoded).

* Warning message for when there are no RCS thrusters.

Version 0.2
-----------
*Release date: 24/06/2013*

* An indication to where your translation or torque vector should be

* FIX: Occasional doubling or disappearance of arrows.
* FIX: Incorrect placement of RCS forces (Evident in mods such as B9).
