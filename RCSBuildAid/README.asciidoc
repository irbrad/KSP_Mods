RCS Build Aid Plugin
====================
Eli√°n Hanisch <lambdae2@gmail.com>
v0.4.6, April 2014:

Aid tool for balancing RCS thrusters around the center of mass while building a
rocket, and a bit more.

Requirements
------------

* KSP version 0.23, 0.23.5

Optional
~~~~~~~~

* blizzy78's toolbar, http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60863
 
Installation
------------

Just copy RCSBuildAid directory into your KSP's GameData directory. 

Features
--------

* Display thrust and torque forces caused by RCS or engines.
* Delta V readout for RCS.
* Dry center of mass marker.
* "Average" center of mass marker.
* The CoM marker represents better the situation in flight.
* Ability to resize editor's overlay markers.
* Display total mass of resources.

Usage
-----

This plugin can only be used while in VAB (Vehicular Assembly Building) or in 
SPH (Space Plane Hangar). If you have blizzy78's toolbar installed, you will see 
RCSBuildAid's button in the toolbar, if you aren't using the toolbar then 
RCSBuildAid will be enabled whenever the Center of Mass (CoM) marker is enabled.
Once enabled, you should see RCSBuildAid's window and an extra red marker 
close to the CoM marker, this is the Dry Center of Mass (DCoM) marker.

Forces
~~~~~~

The forces displayed are of 3 types:

Part forces::
Forces exerted by parts, they are colored cyan for RCS and yellow for engines.

Translation force or thrust::
Colored in green, represents the translation motion of your vessel, essentially 
your vessel's thrust. A green marker near the tip of the arrow indicates  where
it should be pointing ideally.

Torque force::
Colored in red, represents the resulting torque the thrusters are exerting into
your vessel. The effect of this torque is represented by a circular arrow, which 
is proportional to the expected angular acceleration. 
When you see a red arrow, it means that in the current configuration and with 
the given input your vessel will try to rotate, however, depending of your 
vessel's mass and of its distribution this rotation might not be noticeable, you 
can gauge this with the circular arrow. Like in the translation force, a red 
marker in the arrow's tip would be indicating the ideal direction.

Markers
~~~~~~~

CoM::
The Center of Mass marker, colored yellow. You should be familiar with this one,
and if you're a savvy KSP player you will know that some parts, while being 
listed as having mass in the editor, actually don't have any during playtime, 
the most egregious offender being the small gear bay used for planes. This means
that the CoM marker in the stock game isn't accurate when using these parts, but
RCS Build Aid fixes it.

DCoM::
The Dry Center of Mass marker, colored red, indicates the center of mass for
your vessel without resources. Which resources you want to remove can be 
configured from the `Mass` tab.

ACoM::
This is the Average Center of Mass marker, colored orange, shows the middle 
point between the CoM and DCoM.

All forces are referenced to either the CoM or DCoM markers, you select which
one from the GUI. Checking how forces change depending of where your CoM is will
help you to understand how to balance best your vessel, eg, for a vessel that
docks with almost no fuel it would be best to balance RCS around the DCoM and
ignore the CoM marker. If you want your vessel to be balanced in most situations
you need to build your vessel in a way that keeps both center of masses as close
as possible, or if you can't achieve this, balancing around the ACoM marker 
would be the best compromise.

RCS mode
~~~~~~~~

This mode is for balancing RCS, enabled with the `RCS` button. It will show the
torque and translation forces of the installed RCS for the active direction. RCS
forces are represented by cyan vectors.

=== Switching direction

You can change direction from the GUI, or alternatively with the same keys for 
translating your vessel. If default game settings the keys are:

[horizontal]
H :: Set RCS forces to move forward.
N :: Set RCS forces to move backwards.
L :: Set RCS forces to translate right.
J :: Set RCS forces to translate left.
I :: Set RCS forces to translate down.
K :: Set RCS forces to translate up.

NOTE: Setting the same direction twice is a shortcut for disable RCS mode.

=== Balancing RCS

Having balanced RCS means that when you're translating your vessel won't rotate
and when you are rotating it won't translate, this is important for easy
docking. This depends of the position of your CoM and the placement of your
RCS thrusters.

From the GUI you can select to balance either translation or rotation.

==== Balancing translation

The RCS will attempt to translate your vessel to the given direction, with the
green arrow being the actual resulting motion. In this situation you want
translation motion without any rotation, so you want to place your RCS around
your CoM in a way that reduces the torque vector (red arrow) as much as
possible.

NOTE: Is not necessary to completely cancel out the torque force, sometimes 
might be difficult. If you don't see the circular arrow then it means that the
current torque is acceptable and shouldn't interfere during normal docking.

==== Balancing rotation

Is the same than translation except that here you want to reduce the translation
vector (green arrow) while keeping the torque vector aligned with the red
marker. In most vessels you won't need to do this since balanced translation
implies balanced rotation, but this is not always true.

Engine Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~

This mode is for engine balancing, enabled with the `Engines` button. The
engines used for calculating forces are always the engines in the bottommost
stage, if you want to disable some engines you can to move them to a higher
stage.

Markers
~~~~~~~

From the `Mass` tab you will see some information about the mass of your vessel 
and resources, and options for show, hide or change the size of the CoM markers. 
You can also select which type of resource should be removed for the calculation 
of the DCoM, disabled resources will be removed from your vessel's dry mass.

Incompatible plugins
--------------------

This plugin will work only with parts using stock modules. Modded parts with 
custom modules or that had their stock modules replaced will not work.

*Plugins known to be incompatible*

* KerbCom Avionics:: It replaces stock RCS modules with its own.

Known Issues
------------

* Delta V readout for RCS only works when the CoM is selected and isn't 
accurate for modded RCS. In these situations the dV readout will not be shown.

Compiling
---------

This project picks its references for a local directory for avoid commiting the 
absolute path of library files into the repository. So if you want this project
to find its references without changing .csproj files you have create a local 
directory named `Libraries` and copy (or symlink) the directory `Managed` from a 
KSP install and Toolbar.dll from blizzy78's toolbar mod (if you wish to compile 
RCSBuildAidToolbar.dll).

  Libraries\
    Managed -> ${KSP_DIR}/KSP_Data/Managed
    Toolbar.dll -> ${KSP_DIR}/GameData/000_Toolbar/Toolbar.dll
